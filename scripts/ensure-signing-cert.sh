# Ensure a stable, self-signed code-signing certificate exists for the
# voicebridge capture binary, creating it (idempotently) in the login
# keychain if absent.
#
# Why this exists: macOS TCC keys permission grants (Microphone,
# Accessibility) on the *signing identity* of the requesting code. An
# ad-hoc signature (`codesign -s -`) has no stable identity — its cdhash
# changes on every rebuild — so every `make swift` would orphan the
# Microphone and Accessibility grants and force the user to re-toggle them
# in System Settings. Signing with a fixed self-signed certificate gives a
# stable LOCAL identity, so TCC grants persist across rebuilds.
#
# This is deliberately NOT Developer ID / notarization: it produces an
# untrusted-but-stable identity, which is all TCC needs. Gatekeeper trust
# for distribution to other machines is a separate, deferred concern.
#
# Idempotent: a no-op when the certificate already exists.
